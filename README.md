# RayTracer

## How to run
#### Open the terminal in this directory and just type 
```make run```
#### into the terminal and it will compile everything needed and run it

#### To quit the program just type q and press enter.

## Summary
This is a raytracing program written completely in C. Given a txt file that contains the image size, eye/camera location, view direction, up vector of camera/eye, vertical field of view, objects in the 3d space (including their location, size, and colors), and background color, the program can send rays to this abstract 3d scene and generate an image using the Blinn Phong Illumination model. It supports spheres and triangles along with texture mapping to both shapes.

## Examples
#### Here is an example of spheres generated by the program using different colors and the Blinn Phong Illumination Model

#### This image showcases the use of textures on a sphere. The textures are PPM files that are read and mapped to the sphere

### The actual raytracing begins. The next two images simulate 3 spheres, where one is transparent with an index of refraction of 1.5. The difference between the two images is the distance between the 
transparent and opaque spheres.

#### This image incorporates almost everything this program can do using only raycasting: Triangles, Spheres, Illumination with shadows, light attenuation, texture mapping, and flat shading of triangles.

#### This program can use many improvements, such as implementing depth cueing, using bilinear interpolation for generating the triangles instead of nearest neighbors, allowing the ray tracing to happen with a graphics card, and using multithreads. This repository will be constantly updated to add features like this in the future, and optimizations will be made for the general functionality as well.
