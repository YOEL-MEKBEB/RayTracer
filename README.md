# RayTracer

## How to run
#### just type 
```make run```
#### and it will compile everything needed and run it

#### to quit the program just type q and press enter.

## Summary
This is a raytracing program written completely in C. Given a txt file that contains the image size, eye/camera location, view direction, up vector of camera/eye, vertical field of view, objects in the 3d space (including their location, size, and colors), and background color, the program can send rays to this abstract 3d scene and generate an image using the Blinn Phong Illumination model. It supports spheres and triangles along with texture mapping to both shapes.

## Examples
#### Here is an example of spheres generated by the program using different colors and the Blinn Phong Illumination model

#### This image showcases the use of textures on a sphere. The textures are PPM files that are read and mapped to the sphere

#### This image showcases the use of triangles, mapping textures to triangles, and smooth shading using interpolated normals

#### This final image incorporates almost everything this program can do for now: Triangles, Spheres, Illumination with shadows, light attenuation, texture mapping, and flat shading of triangles.

#### This program can use many improvements like implementing transparent objects and mirrors, depth cueing, using bilinear interpolation for generating the triangles instead of nearest neighbors, allowing the ray tracing to happen with a graphics and also multithread. This repository will be in constant update to add features like this in the future and optimizations will be made for the general functionaity as well.
